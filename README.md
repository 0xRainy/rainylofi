## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

This program leverages the power of `mpv` (a versatile command-line media player) for audio playback.

1.  **MPV Instances:** For each sound source (lofi, rain, storm), a separate `mpv` process is started in the background.
    *   Lofi music is streamed directly from the YouTube URL (requires `yt-dlp` or `youtube-dl` to be installed for `mpv` to resolve it).
    *   Rain and storm sounds are played from local `.ogg` files.
2.  **IPC Control:** The script communicates with each `mpv` instance via its IPC (Inter-Process Communication) socket. JSON commands are sent to control properties like volume and pause state.
3.  **Curses TUI:** The `curses` library is used to create the text-based user interface, manage screen drawing, and handle keyboard input.
4.  **State Management:** Python dictionaries keep track of the desired and actual state of each sound (playing, volume, running status, errors).
5.  **Animation Loop:** A main loop refreshes the UI at regular intervals, updating animations based on the current sound states and random events.
6.  **Internet Check:** Before attempting to play the lofi stream, and if the stream unexpectedly stops, a simple socket connection to a public DNS server is made to check for general internet connectivity.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies & Setup

Make sure you have the following installed:

1.  **Python 3.7+**
2.  **`mpv` Media Player:**
    *   **Linux:** `sudo apt install mpv` or `sudo pacman -S mpv` (or your distro's equivalent).
    *   **macOS:** `brew install mpv`.
    *   **Windows:** Download from [mpv.io](https://mpv.io/installation/) and ensure `mpv.exe` is in your system's PATH.
3.  **`yt-dlp` (Recommended) or `youtube-dl`:**
    *   Needed by `mpv` to play YouTube streams.
    *   Install via pip: `pip install yt-dlp`
    *   Or download from [yt-dlp GitHub](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#installation).
4.  **Python `curses` library:**
    *   **Linux/macOS:** Usually included with Python.
    *   **Windows:** `pip install windows-curses`

**Optional Audio Files:**

*   Place `rain.ogg` and `storm.ogg` files in the same directory as the script for local ambient sounds. If not found, the script will attempt to create empty files (which won't produce sound). You can find free `.ogg` sound effects online!
